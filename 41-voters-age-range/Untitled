Given an array of potential voters, return an object representing the results of the vote
Include how many of the potential voters were in the ages 18-25, how many from 26-35,
how many from 36-55, and how many of each of those age ranges actually voted.
The resulting object containing this data should have 6 properties.
See the example output at the bottom.

var voters = [
    {name:'Bob' , age: 30, voted: true},
    {name:'Jake' , age: 32, voted: true},
    {name:'Kate' , age: 25, voted: false},
    {name:'Sam' , age: 20, voted: false},
    {name:'Phil' , age: 21, voted: true},
    {name:'Ed' , age:55, voted:true},
    {name:'Tami' , age: 54, voted:true},
    {name: 'Mary', age: 31, voted: false},
    {name: 'Becky', age: 43, voted: false},
    {name: 'Joey', age: 41, voted: true},
    {name: 'Jeff', age: 30, voted: true},
    {name: 'Zack', age: 19, voted: false}
];

function voterResults(arr) {
   // your code here
}

console.log(voterResults(voters)); // Returned value shown below:
/*

  youth: 4,
